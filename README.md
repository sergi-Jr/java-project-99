### Hexlet tests and linter status:


## Description
The project is an input data validation library.
Currently, it supports the following types of validation: **strings**, **integers**, **Map<T,R> collections** (where **T** is a key - any type, and **R** is a value - from types suitable for validation).  
The designed validation schemes support an "on-the-fly" configuration format.
